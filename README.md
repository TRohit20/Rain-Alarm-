# Rain-Alarm-
This is mini project that alerts upon water or rain detection. Did this project to learn about integrated circuits applications.
Rain Alarm Project is a simple but very useful project that detects Rain(Rain Water) and automatically triggers an alarm or buzzer
Water is a basic need in everyoneâ€™s life. Saving water and proper usage of water is very important. Here is an easy project which will give the alarm when there is rain, so that we can make some actions for rain water harvesting and also save the rain water for using it later.
With the help of saving water through rain water harvesting, we can increase the levels of underground water by using underground recharge technique.
Rain Water detector will detect the rain and make an alert, rain water detector is used in the irrigation field, home automation, communication, automobiles etc. Here is the simple and reliable circuit of rain water detector which can be constructed at low cost.
